# Public personal goals

I want to share the goals I have set for myself. With the aim to improve my productivity and track progress.

- [Goals](https://github.com/cwinters/personal-goals/issues?state=open)
- [Accomplishments](https://github.com/cwinters/personal-goals/issues?state=closed)

Each goal is logged as an issue. A closed ticket represents an accomplishment.

Please feel free to contribute to my goals. Feedback, criticism, and help are
appreciated. Just add your comments to the relevant issue.

Thanks to [slashdotdash](https://github.com/slashdotdash/personal-goals) for inspiration,
and [Dustin](https://github.com/dustinupdyke) for the pointer.
